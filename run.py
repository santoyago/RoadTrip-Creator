# This file runs the route planner algorithm
# This code will open "map.txt" and take info about cities and routes between them
# run "run.py city1 city2 city3" in cmd to display route between city1, city2, city3
# IMPORTANT: put each argument in quotes - eg: "San Francisco, CA"
    # See "example_cmd.jpg" for command line example

#HOW TO RUN:
# cityList contains list of cities that you wish to visit, in order.
# you will start from the city at index 0, and will iterate through list.
# IMPORTANT: code will not work if there are <2 cities in list.

#default list of cities
cityList = ["New York City, NY","Jacksonville, FL", "Washington, DC", "San Francisco, CA", "Las Vegas, NV"]
